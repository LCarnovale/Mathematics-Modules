# Mathematics-Modules
Python libraries to support more complicated mathematics.

rational.py - Rational number object, 
  allows exact representation of any rational number by storing each object as a numerator and denominator,
  both strictly as integers, eleminating the risk of floating point eror.
  
vector.py   - Vector object,
  contains the vectorr object, which allows forr operations involving traditional vector arithmetic (such as dot products, cross products etc.)
